## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AGRISISTANCE project locally:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): This project requires Python to run. Download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): You‚Äôll need Git to clone the repository. Download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- [Docker](https://docker.com/): Docker is required to run the databases.

## Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flh-raouf/agrisistance-model-microservice.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd https://github.com/flh-raouf/agrisistance-model-microservice
    ```

## Installing Dependencies

1. **Install project dependencies**: Run the following command to install all the required npm packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project with the following structure:

    ```plaintext
        POSTGRES_USER = ''
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD = ''
        POSTGRES_LAND_DB = 'agrisistance_land_db'
        DATABASE_LAND_URL='postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@127.0.0.1:5434/${POSTGRES_LAND_DB}?schema=public'

        API_TOKEN = ''
        API_URL = 'https://api.afro.fit/api_v2/api_wrapper/chat/completions'

    ```
2. **Explanation of Environment Variables**:

    - `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_LAND_DB` : Configuration for PostgreSQL databases.
    - `API_TOKEN` : OpenAI token
    

## Running the Application

1. **Start Docker Containers for Database**:

  - Ensure that Docker is running, either in the foreground or background, before proceeding. 

    - Start the land database container:
      ```bash
      docker compose up agrisistance-land-db -d
      ```

    By following these steps, your databases should be up and running. To verify that everything is working correctly, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
        docker ps
    ```

2. **Run Prisma Migrations for Each Database**:

    - Migrate the land database if you haven't done this step in the NestJS miroservices:
      ```bash
      prisma migrate dev --schema=./prisma/schema.land.prisma
      ```

3. **Generate Types for the Project**:

    - Generate types for the land service:
      ```bash
        prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.land.prisma
      ```

    

4. **Launch Databases with Prisma Studio**:

    - Open Prisma Studio for the user service:
      ```bash
      prisma studio --schema=./prisma/schema.land.prisma
      ```

5. **Run the Project Services**:

    - Start the service:
      ```bash
      uvicorn server:asgi_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
      ```
    Your project should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

6. **Run the NestJS Microservices**:

    - The NestJS microservices handles user authentication and other functionalities. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/flh-raouf/agrisistance-microservice).


 ## Postman Documentation

   After running the server, you can use the Postman collection to test the available endpoints. The Postman documentation provides a detailed overview of all the requests you can make to interact with the API.

   - You can find the Postman documentation for this project [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/32136798/2sAXqngkQA).

   Make sure the server is running at `http://localhost:9090` before testing the endpoints in Postman.
