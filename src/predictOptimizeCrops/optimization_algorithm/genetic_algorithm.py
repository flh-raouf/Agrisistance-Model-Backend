    Run a genetic algorithm to optimize crop distribution for maximum profit.
    
    Parameters:
    - crops: List of crops (not used directly in the algorithm, but relevant for context).
    - cost_per_m2: 1D numpy array representing the cost per square meter for each crop.
    - revenue_per_m2: 1D numpy array representing the revenue per square meter for each crop.
    - total_area: Total available area for planting (int).
    - total_budget: Total budget available for planting (int).
    - population_size: Number of individuals in the population (int).
    - num_generations: Number of generations to run the algorithm (int).
    - mutation_rate: Probability of mutation for each gene (float between 0 and 1).
